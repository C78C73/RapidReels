Rapid Reels was developed by Mikey Joyce, Zack Murry, Colin Buchheit, and Gage Smith for TigerHacks, the University of Missouri's annual hackathon,
placing first out of 33 projects in the developer category. TigerHacks 2023 took place on November 3-5 and called for projects related to the theme of "Media."

Our project is intended to address the problems creators face with the rising popularity of short-form video content on platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.
Many content creators make longer videos and then manually trim down the best parts to repost on these platforms; Rapid Reels automates this process by using data about what real
users are most entertained by, which we find by analyzing the segments users rewatch the most.
